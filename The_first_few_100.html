	<p>
		In The Few 100 you begin as a tribe of 10 people in the stone age. You are represented by a stickman carying spear. <br> The stickman is standing on a tile. All around him are other tiles with different icons, there cound be trees, deer, mountains etc.. <br> At the begining of your turn you can stay on, or move onto another tile. You will then recieve 3 random options to chose from. <br> For example: if you move to a forest tile, you can: 
	</p>

	<ol> <li>Investigate a strange buzzing sound,</li> <li >Colect branches,</li> <li>Pick fruit from trees,</li>  </ol>

	<p>When you chose one of options you will get different results. For the buzzing sound you might discover honey -which will give you food <br> (an essential reource) or recieve damage to your tribe from being stung by bees, or both. <br>
	over the turns you will discover new technologies. An example is making tents. <br> If you have colected wood and then hunt animals you will be able to join hides with branches to make a tent. <br> each technology will give you new advantages: the tent will keep you warm at night, meaning you will need less food to fuel your tribe </p>
